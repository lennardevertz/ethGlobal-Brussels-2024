## Benefits

- You instantly recognize your identity, distinguish it from other data in the explorer's interface, and boost your confidence in using the right address.
- Interacting with @username instead of a regular address gives you more context about other wallets and a way to message the owner.
- Helps with verifying whether a given address is a real human.
